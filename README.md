# 🛒 Simple Shopping Cart CLI App

Create a CLI-based shopping experience using basic Python programming concepts, ideal for beginners who want to practice and understand essential programming structures in a fun and interactive way!

---

## Introduction 🌍

Shopping carts are a core feature of online stores, allowing customers to select and manage products before checkout. This project simulates a simplified version of that concept within the command-line interface (CLI), perfect for learning how to structure programs using classes, loops, conditionals, and functions.

The project is also equipped with unit tests, so developers can learn test-driven development practices while building this app.
